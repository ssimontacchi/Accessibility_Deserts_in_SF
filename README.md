Identifying Accessibility Deserts in San Francisco

As someone with a disabled brother, I would like to use my time in the program to develop an interactive map that will identify accessibility deserts in San Francisco. To accomplish this, I will first use elevation contour maps to determine, with machine learning, a function that will predict elevation given a click on a map of the city. Then, factoring in the distance and change in elevation to get to the nearest bus stop, I will be able to use this information to create a heatmap of the city, with a focus on ease of accessibility. This analysis could also benefit private transportation companies like Lyft and Uber to help select the easiest locations for pickup, where to send drivers to serve the handicapped. This project could also be extremely useful for company marketing.
